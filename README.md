# Lab #2
## By Lawrence Nobuyoshi Lorbiecki

For my second lab I decided to search geotagged tweets based on the keyword college.
This was in an effort to see the different sentiments towards college in several different
major cities. I chose the cities Seattle, New York and Los Angeles. These were chosen because
of how different there geographic location is but also how different their college cultures are.

The first image we will look at is the one for the Seattle Area:

as you can see, several of the words in the word cloud are ones that you would expect in any sentence
whether it was related to college or not. But if we take a closer look there are some words that 
stick out as pretty unique such as:
- Football
- Seattle
- Desantis
- Florida

The rest of the cloud looks to be pretty standard stuff. But it is interesting to see the differences
when we look at the word cloud for New York:

In this word cloud we can see more of the standard words that are usually there for the word cloud
that was for Seattle. But if we look closer we can see that there are some differences
- Basketball is noticeably bigger than football
- Brooklyn
- Trains
- Business

Finally we should be looking at Los Angeles' word cloud. This one happens to share some aspects
of both Seattle and New York. 

[Los Angeles](https://github.com/NobuLNL/GEOGLAB2REPO/blob/ec3c5b1abf8e89b07983c7772d3a323c68a85824/img/LosAngelesWordArt.png)

When we look at the Los Angeles word cloud we can see that basketball yet again is much larger
than football. We will get back to this in a second but lets look at some of the words again
- Basketball is larger than football
- Juco
- Football is still large
- Jersey

All of these cities have different words but if we look at the reasoning between why there may
be these differences between each of the cities. In regards to New York and Los Angeles
having a much bigger basketball word compared to the football word makes sense considering
that the colleges in both of those cities have much bigger basketball programs compared to
their respective football programs. Also in California we see that there is a large word JUCO
in the cloud. This could be due to the high amount of Junior Colleges (often abbreviated to JUCO)
in California, in which players will play for a while before either transferring to a college
or going to the NFL or NBA draft.

In the future I would most likely remove a lot of the words that were far too common. College
was also possibly way too broad of a term and as a result garnered a bunch of unrelated results.
The biggest issues I have with my word clouds right now is my prevalence of meaningless words
that overall contribute nothing to my overall thesis. I really do wish that I could have
better refined my search.
